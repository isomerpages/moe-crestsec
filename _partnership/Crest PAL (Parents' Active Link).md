All our students’ parents/guardians are part of the Crest PAL community.<br>The school works with the Crest PAL ExCo to organize activities for all parents such as parents’ dialogues and parenting workshops. Other activities include learning journeys, as well as sports and games to promote parent-child interaction and bonding. Some examples include laser tag, archery tag, soccer, bowling, cooking, baking, pizza making, learning journeys to farms etc.<br>Over the years, we have parents who volunteer actively in our school events, such as the Education and Career Guidance (ECG) fair, Open House and Cross Country Run. We certainly welcome more parents to join us!</em>

<em>Serving as a parent volunteer in Crest is my way of expressing my gratitude to the teachers of Crest. They have given my children not just a holistic Secondary School education but also given them back their confidence, self-esteem and identity. Through Crest, my children have grown to be independent learners and responsible youths. This is because Crest teachers teach with their heart.</em><br>- Quote from Chairman, Ms Celestine Lau.
