#### Books / Uniforms / Shoes / Socks list for 2023

Dear parent/guardian,

  

The 2023 price lists for school textbooks, uniforms/shoes/socks are attached for your reference.

For non-FAS students, the school has arranged for the vendors to provide online purchase and delivery for the items. We encourage you to opt for online modes where possible to minimize the number of visitors to the school.

  

You may access these links to do the online purchase :

For books:&nbsp;[www.asencio.com.sg](http://www.asencio.com.sg/)

For uniforms and school shoes:&nbsp;[www.shanghai-uniforms.com](http://www.shanghai-uniforms.com/)

  

For those who have applied for FAS with the school, you should have received a PG notification on 16 Nov 2022. If your child/ward is on the 3E programme, you will be notified before end November on their allocated course and hence, please do not purchase any textbooks first.
