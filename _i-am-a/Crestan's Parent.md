<p>2. For general inquiries, please contact the Admin Office at 6899 2779
or email <a href="mailto:info@crestsec.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">info@crestsec.edu.sg</a>.
Our administration staff will be happy to assist you. For urgent messages
during school hours, we recommend contacting the Admin Office, as teachers
may be in class or attending to other duties.</p>
<p>3. To ensure our teachers have time to rest and recharge, we kindly request
parents to limit communication with teachers to school operating hours
(7:30 am to 5:30 pm) on weekdays during the school term. Teachers are not
expected to respond to queries from parents or students outside these hours,
on weekends, or during school and public holidays, unless the matter is
urgent and requires immediate attention.</p>
<p>4. Please note that teachers are not required to share their personal
phone numbers with parents or students. Parents are encouraged to discuss
with their child’s teacher the preferred mode of communication.</p>
<p>5. Parents can expect a response to their email inquiries within three
working days. Our staff's email addresses are available on the school website.</p>
<p>6. If parents wish to meet with our teachers in person or virtually, please
email the teacher(s) or contact the Admin Office to schedule an appointment
in advance. This helps minimize disruptions to teaching duties and reduces
wait times.</p>
