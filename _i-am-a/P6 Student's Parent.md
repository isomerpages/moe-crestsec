<h4><strong><em>Ask Me Anything</em> about Crest Secondary School (CSS)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is CSS set up?</strong>
</p>
<p>MOE is committed to supporting the learning needs of all students. The
establishment of CSS complements MOE’s on-going efforts in providing students
with an engaging learning experience, such as a curriculum that emphasises
the building of students’ self-motivation and self-esteem, character development,
and literacy and numeracy skills. CSS offers a&nbsp;customised four-year
curriculum that integrates both academic learning and vocational training&nbsp;to
provide students with skills-based, practice-oriented learning experiences.
In addition, Character and Citizenship Education undergirds CSS’ holistic
education approach, with a strong focus on values education and social
and emotional learning to prepare students for future learning, employment
and adulthood.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the curriculum offered at CSS?</strong>
</p>
<p>CSS offers academic subjects and the ITE Skills Subject Certificate (ISSC).
At lower secondary, students will be exposed to the 5 ITE Skills Subjects
by way of Taster Modules. This will allow them to enjoy the range of skills
options while allowing them to discover the interest and aptitude for each
area before they select 2 subjects to specialise in at upper secondary.&nbsp;To
support the learning of our higher ability students, the school may offer
English Language Mathematics and/or Mother Tongue Language at the G2 level
to these students, starting from Sec 1, if they meet the school’s eligibility
criteria.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are students assessed at CSS?</strong>
</p>
<p>CSS adopts a skills-based, formative assessment approach to scaffold students’
learning and enable them to achieve the learning goals. Continual assessment,
such as practice-based assessment, constitutes a major component of the
overall assessment of students’ performance across subjects. For Taster
Modules, students will sit for an end-of-module assessment at the end of
each semester. In addition, students will sit for the End-of-Year Assessments
for academic subjects.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What qualifications will CSS students graduate with?</strong>
</p>
<p>CSS students will graduate at Sec 4 with the Singapore-Cambridge Secondary
Education Certificate (SEC) and the ITE Skills Subjects Certificate (ISSC).
With these qualifications, CSS students can apply for Nitec courses at
any of the three Institute of Technical Education (ITE) colleges.</p>
<p>
<br>Sec 4 students with special talent and skills aptitude e.g. sports, performing
arts, technical &amp; vocational skills may apply to ITE for early admission
to their preferred Nitec courses via the ITE Early Admission Exercise,
prior to the release of the Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate
(SEC) results.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What are the criteria for student admission into CSS?</strong>
</p>
<p>All P6, G1, G1/G2 eligible students may apply for admission to CSS. The
school will evaluate each applicant carefully, taking into consideration
the student’s potential to benefit from its skills-based, practice-oriented
curriculum. All P6 eligible students will receive a letter inviting them
to apply for admission into CSS when they receive their PSLE results from
their primary school.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Assistance for Students</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore Citizen students from low-income families may apply for the
MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE-FAS) if they meet the specified gross
household income or per capita income criteria. This comprehensive scheme
supports needy students by providing:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>
<li>
<p>Free school uniform and vocational attire</p>

</ul>
<p>Parents can apply online at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/moe-efasss</a>
</p>
<p>For students who do not qualify for MOE-FAS but still require financial
support, the school offers its own financial assistance scheme. Applications
for school-based assistance are assessed individually, taking into account
each family's unique circumstances and financial needs.</p>
