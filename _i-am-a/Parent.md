#### Relaxation of the Safe Management Measures 

Dear Parents/Guardians,

With further relaxation of the Safe Management Measures announced on 24 August, mask-wearing will be optional in both indoor and outdoor settings with effect from 29 August. These changes apply to MOE schools as well. However, please remind your child that it is still mandatory to put on his/her mask if he/she takes the public transport. (Note: For the morning shuttle bus and bus transport arranged by the school (e.g. for Learning Journeys, etc.), wearing of mask by students is optional).

  

As we strive towards living with COVID, let us continue to practise good personal hygiene and exercise social responsibility. Together, we can make the school a safer place for all students.  

  

Thank you for your partnership.

#### Handbrake Requirement for Bicycles

Dear parent/guardian,    
Over the past few years, we have seen an increase in the number of people using bicycles as a mode of transport or for leisure, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. This may include students who cycle to and from school, or during the weekends with friends and families. Some of these students who cycle may be fixie enthusiasts. Fixies, also known as fixed-gear bicycles, generally do not have hand-operated brakes, but instead, rely on the rider’s pedal resistance to stop. This makes it challenging for riders to brake quickly, endangering themselves and other path and road users.    
   
To improve safety, from 1 September 2021, all bicycles are ridden on public paths and roads must have at least one functioning handbrake.    
  
Please see LTA’s Facebook post and poster on this new rule for your information.   We also wish to inform parents that students may only be allowed to cycle to school with their parents’ knowledge through a parents’ advisory note. Students who cycle to school should also wear protective gear, such as a helmet, and have a bicycle lock to secure their bicycles at the bicycle racks.

Thank you.
