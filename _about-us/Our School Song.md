**Verse 1:**

_I have found a place_

_Where my heart is free to dream_

_It's here that I belong_

_Where strength rises from within_

_All the things I hope for_

_They're mine to strive for_

_I'll rise up to the challenge_

_To turn my dreams into reality_


**Chorus:**

_I know I can_

_I'm reaching high_

_To touch the sky_

_I'm not afraid to try_

_To realise my dreams_

_Upon this Crest_

_I'll do my best_

_To be all that I was meant to be_

_I'll shout it to the world_

_I know I can_


  

  

**Verse 2:**


_The road will not be easy_

_But no matter how long it seems_

_I'll just keep walking on_

_I'll never give up on my dreams_

_There'll always be a helping hand_

_And someone who will be a friend_

_In this place that feels like home_

_I know I'll never have to walk alone_

  

**(Chorus x 2)**

**Composed By**

**Mr Adrian Tay and Mr Matthias Chua**
