It is here that I belong, where strength rises from within. All the things I hope for, they are mine to thrive for. I will rise up to the challenge to turn my dreams into reality. I know I can! I am reaching high, to touch the sky. I am not afraid to try, to realise my dreams. Upon this Crest, I will do my best, to be all that I can be. I’ll shout it to the world, I know, I can! The road may not be easy, but no matter how long it seems, I’ll just keep walking on. I’ll never give up. There’ll always be a helping hand, and someone who will be a friend. In this place that feels like home, I know I’ll never have to walk alone …  
Lyrics of Crest Secondary School Song"_


**Dear Students, Parents and Partners,**

  

The lyrics of our school song strike a strong cord with me and, I am certain it is the same with every student, parent, teacher and staff in Crest Secondary. It summarises the heartbeat of what Crest Secondary is all about. It is not just words. It is our collective aspirations and hope for our students, to overcome their personal challenges with the “I Know I Can” spirit, and be “empowered to realise my dreams”, as in our school motto.

  

Crest Secondary is not just a school, it is a home for our students, a place where they can find genuine care, love, and warmth from their teachers, teachers who believe in them, walk alongside them and support them all the way to become persons of good character, equipped with a set of life skills in pursuit of their passion.

  

Crest Secondary is also a home to all the teachers as none them are posted here – every single teacher chooses to apply to teach in Crest. We share a common heartbeat, and a common mission in wanting to make a difference to the lives of every Primary 6 child who chooses Crest Secondary as their choice school.

  

In Crest Secondary, we help our students re-define success in life as we recognise that many of them are **N**aturally **T**alented (another abbreviation for NT) and are good with their hands. As the first Specialised School for **N**ormal **T**echnical (NT) stream, we are able to innovate and do things differently with our "**3R**" mission:

  

*   **Reboot** learning experiences and taste success. We want our students to know that their PSLE score does not define who they are, and we believe they have natural talents yet to be uncovered. Hence, we provide a “caring” environment with an “integrated hands-on” learning curriculum, so that our students love coming to school to discover their strengths and passion, feel motivated, inspired and experience success in areas beyond the academics.

  

*   **Re-condition** habits toward self-discipline: We set high expectations on discipline and put in place routines to regulate our student’s social habits, emphasise the importance of social emotional learning and teamwork to help them empathise, love and care for one another, appreciate the school and the environment. We hope they develop a deep sense of identity, pride and belonging.

  

*   **Restore** self-confidence, self-esteem and self-worth. We provide a skills-based, practice-oriented curriculum to excite and better engage our students in experiential learning in a “real-world", authentic, environment. We strategically scaffold our teaching and learning, integrating academic and vocational education, as well as enrichment programmes to equip our students with life skills,help them to discover their interests, talents and taste success beyond the academic areas.

  

It is my pleasure to work alongside my team of dedicated teachers and staff who have a big heart for NT students and who have joined Crest to play a role in this exceptional “life-giving” and “life-changing” work. I am so glad we all share a common vision, and a strong conviction and belief that every student can become someone significant with strength of character who can contribute to our community, Singapore and beyond. This is why our school vision is “Advocating a Promising Future for Every Student” in Crest.

  

I take this opportunity to thank all our stakeholders – Board members, Parents, and Partners who play significant roles in the educational transformation of our students. Board members provide the advisory role to the school, parents take care of the well-being and development of the child at home and partners provide opportunities for our students via internships, industrial attachments, financial assistance and character development of our students. Together, I am confident Crest Secondary will continue to grow from strength to strength and scale new heights.
