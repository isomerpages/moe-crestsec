<h4>Subject-based banding (SBB) Briefing</h4>
<p>There will be a briefing on SBB for students who are eligible. Parents
will be contacted through SMS with further details.</p>
<h4>Bus Routes</h4>
<p>Due to a persistent island wide shortage of drivers for both private and
public buses, the school is unable to procure shuttle bus services for
the school from 2 Jan 2024 onwards. The one-way shuttle bus service will
hence be ceased from year 2024 onwards. Students are to consider alternative
transportation arrangements, such as utilizing public transportation options
or carpooling. We appreciate support and understanding from students and
parents/guardians.</p>
