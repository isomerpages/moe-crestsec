Due to a persistent island wide shortage of drivers for both private and public buses, the school is unable to procure shuttle bus services for the school from 2 Jan 2024 onwards.  The one-way shuttle bus service will hence be ceased from year 2024 onwards. Students are to consider alternative transportation arrangements, such as utilizing public transportation options or carpooling. We appreciate support and understanding from students and parents/guardians.
