### Beliefs

<img src="/images/fb1.jpg" style="width:75%">

Our Fundamental Beliefs about our students influence the way we interact with them, which in turn influences how our students perceive themselves and relate to others, their attitude towards school and their sense of self-worth.

  

The core value undergirding our Fundamental Beliefs is the&nbsp;**care for our students**. When we care for our students, we affirm their self-worth, assure them that they are important to us, and commit ourselves to helping them ride the crest of personal transformation and improvement. Our teachers also embrace a&nbsp;**growth mindset**&nbsp;towards teaching our students by setting high, realistic expectations. With hard work and perseverance and support from the teachers, our students will be able to succeed.
