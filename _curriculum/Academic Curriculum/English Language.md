<h3>English Language</h3>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>The English Language Department aims to develop Crestans into confident
communicators by infusing a specially curated blended approach into our
curriculum.</p>
<p>We aim for students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>express themselves coherently through speaking and writing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>showcase their strengths and work on areas for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use the language meaningfully in everyday life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inculcate a love for reading</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The four-year programme is designed based on our department’s unique pedagogical
framework which guides us in planning and executing our lessons:</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>reate interest</p>
<p><strong>R</strong>ehearse, Reinforce, Recode</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>xperience</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>tructures</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>ask</p>
<p>Our lessons are thematically designed and cascaded in such a way that
learning is progressive and gradual over the four years. Students are given
the opportunities to hone their language skills in authentic, real-world
contexts such as making small talk in a social setting and checking in
to a hotel through role-play.</p>
<p>In Crest, we believe every student can learn. As such, encouraging formative
assessments form an integral part of the holistic assessments. Engaging
lessons with enriching supporting activities are created to ensure learning
takes place meaningfully.</p>
<p>At the end of four years, all Crestans would be able to communicate confidently
and effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p>These are some of our signature programmes.</p>

<p>This alternative assessment is the culmination of the teaching, learning
and application of effective oral communication skills for the Secondary
1 students over three terms. Students take on the roles of Crest Ambassador,
Host, Visitor and Head Waiter, and apply their oracy skills by engaging
in small talk while light refreshments are being served, in the authentic
context of our Bistro / Cafe.</p>

<p>Students embark on a Learning Journey (LJ) to experience what it is like
to be a tourist in Singapore, taking a river taxi and exploring the iconic
Marina Bay Sands. In addition to enjoying the sights, they interact with
visitors from around the world through an interview activity. This experience
not only exposes them to authentic hospitality and customer service but
also equips them with knowledge that they can apply during Check-in@Crest
as they learn to make recommendations to guests.</p>

<p>The Sec 3 Talk Show Project helps students develop interview and audience
engagement skills while further honing their oracy abilities. Through role-playing
as either a host or a guest, students apply techniques learned in class,

through a blended learning approach. Whether attending a live production
or watching online, students were exposed to the vibrant local theatre
scene. The experience sometimes included a drama workshop, where they learnt
to communicate clearly and confidently through theatre games. The programme
usually concludes with a post-show segment, offering students the unique
opportunity to engage with the playwright and actors, deepening their understanding
of theatrical performance and storytelling.</p>

learning with a shared dining experience. As a class, they sample a variety
of dishes, fostering camaraderie through food. Following the meal, students
apply their writing skills to craft authentic food reviews and recommendations,

This real-world context allows them to refine their descriptive writing
and evaluative skills in a meaningful and enjoyable way.</p>

sharpening both their critical thinking and oracy skills in preparation
for their oral exams. Contestants compete by delivering impromptu speeches
on a variety of topics, demonstrating their ability to organize thoughts

ideas effectively under pressure.</p>
