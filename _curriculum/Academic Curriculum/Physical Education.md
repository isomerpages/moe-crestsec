<p>The Physical Education Department offers a four-year programme for every
student to learn a variety of sports skills and game concepts, which hopefully
will enable them to adopt a preferred game for lifelong recreation.</p>
<p>The programme aims to inculcate in students a commitment to healthy lifestyle
and to improve their fitness levels. Students will learn about muscular
endurance and cardiovascular fitness, so that they can craft their own
fitness regimes and maintain a healthy lifestyle. With an increase in fitness
levels, they will be able to do well in the National Physical Fitness Award
(NAPFA) and to carry out their day-to-day activities with energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the programme at Crest, students will acquire an understanding
of movement concepts, strategies and tactics in sports and games. They
will also develop as confident, resilient and versatile individuals, who
are adept in sports, are good team players and exhibit sportsmanship-like
behaviour.</p>
