<img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/art1.jpg">
</div>
<p><strong>Arts as a tool</strong>
<br>Crest Aesthetics Programme explores possibilities and experiments with
a mixture of traditional and contemporary art forms through 3 domains of
Aesthetics: Art, Dance, and Music. We engage our students in our customised
Aesthetics curriculum to help our students to use the Arts as a tool, to
foster a sense of identity, to better understand oneself and others, and
to discover the multicultural elements of the intangible cultural heritage
that exists in Singapore, thereby helping them better appreciate and understand
the diverse cultures that make up Singapore.</p>

<p>We aim to develop the Crestan as a confident person who is able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creatively express ideas, feelings &amp; thoughts through selected media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with his/her team members to produce a piece of work taking into
consideration the purpose, audience and context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate the different arts forms and their applications</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Programme Overview</h4>
<p>The design of the programme is aimed at empowering students’ transformation
through the arts via a two pronged approach:</p>
<p>(i) Broad-based programme - Conducted through the curriculum which consists
of the following art forms, namely, music, arts and dance.</p>
<p>(ii) Depth--Conducted through the CCAs, e.g.: Pop Band, Dance and Circus
Arts.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/aes3.jpg">
</div>
<p>This two pronged approach is designed with four components as emphasis
(EPIC) in the Crest Arts:</p>
<p><strong>(E) Expression of Self</strong>: An important aspect of Crest
Arts programme is to encourage students to express their ideas and feelings
thoughtfully through the creation of a performance or art piece.</p>
<p><strong>(P) Processes &amp; Skills</strong>:&nbsp;Through the arts, we
hope to facilitate development of students’ ability to understand and put
in place work processes and skills, such as organizing, prioritizing and
planning.</p>
<p><strong>(I) Inventive thinking</strong>: The design of the Crest Arts
programme includes inculcating creative thinking in students to think of
out of the box solutions.</p>
<p><strong>(C) Connecting with others</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme
is also crafted in such a way to instill a sense of awareness and sensitivity
to their audience in the process of developing an end product. Moreover,
given many of the students’ art works are publicized to the community through
events, the Crest art department has fostered a relationship with members
of the public through the artworks.</p>
<p>Our signature programmes are (i) Body Movement and Dance Programme, (ii)
Sec One Level-wide Art Programme, (iii) Masterclass for various arts CCAs
and (iv) Learning journeys to arts venues and / or arts institution. All
these are conducted to enrich the students’ experience of the arts</p>
<h4>Strengthening 3R through Engagement in Art and Aesthetics</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary Crest Art (Secondary 1 and 2)</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Crest Art experiments with a mixture of conventional and unconventional
mediums (coasters, paper bags, caps, canvas and masks) to engage the students
in colours and design concepts. The purpose is to let the students find
art making meaningful, discover and have a deeper understanding of their
own cultural heritage, and provide them with an authentic learning experience
so that they can use or wear the art that they have created and at the
same time, contribute back to the school.</p>
<p>The personalisation of art pieces motivate students to do well when all
completed artworks are exhibited around the school. Incorporating such
authentic tasks leads to meaningful outcomes as it boosts students’ self-worth
and gives them an added motivation to ensure that their works are well
done.&nbsp;One good example is the Imagine! Series, which are modules that
culminate into collective art pieces being exhibited around the school
compound, making the school campus an art gallery.</p>
<p>Another example is the Artists’ Expression&nbsp;where the ‘Show and Tell’
component provides an oral presentation platform for every student to articulate
why they like their own creation or their friend’s artwork. These provide
a composite learning experience for the students to grow in character,
interpersonal relationships and art techniques.</p>

<p>The Performing Arts Programme provides an opportunity for every Sec 1
class to put up a showcase (Cajon, dance performance and competition) during
school assembly. Besides bonding the class, it also creates an opportunity
for all students to have an appreciation of musical instruments, movement
and dance, including understanding rhythm, types of body movement, work
on their motor coordination and skills. This brings about creativity, imagination
and visualisation, and builds on the school values of Resilience, Excellence
and Teamwork.</p>

<h4>Sec One Level-wide Art Programme</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/aes5.jpg">
</div>
<p>The level-wide programme provides the Sec One students the opportunity
to have a collective theme-based learning in a group setting. They will
be exposed to a wide range of art mediums. This shared learning experience
of making art for the school to spruce up the school learning environment
helps to create a sense of belonging for them. The completed artwork will
give them a sense of pride and a shared learning experience.</p>

<p>The AISS scheme provides students with a platform to interact and work
alongside artists and the community. Through this customized program, students
foster social-emotional learning, self-confidence and community contribution
as they engage with community residents, understanding community needs
and relating to the larger community. Extending learning beyond classrooms,
students participate in photo-walks at Yuhua estate, interacting with residents
and exploring blended learning through traditional and digital art mediums.</p>
