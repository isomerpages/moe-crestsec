<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>The Mathematics Department is dedicated to:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Revitalizing Crestans’ success in Mathematics.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Making Mathematics relevant and fun.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Inspiring students to take charge of their learning.</p>
<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p>In addition to dynamic classroom activities, Crestans have the chance
to apply their Mathematical skills in real-life settings through Learning
Journeys and Alternative Assessments. This hands-on approach helps students
discover the connections between Mathematics and other subjects, making
their learning more meaningful and relevant.</p>

<p>The Popcorn Making activity allows our Crestans to understand the importance
of ratio, cost and profit, while showcasing their retail service skills
to promote and sell their product.</p>
<p>

</div>
<p>During the Bubble Tea Making activity, our Crestans apply their knowledge
about proportion and similar figures, while learning the importance of
food handling and food hygiene skills during preparation.</p>
<p>

</div>
<p>Students make measurements and apply their mathematical concepts to see
the world through the mathematical lens. For example, they measure the
radii and circumference of circles, then compare the calculated circumference
against the measured circumference.</p>
<p>

</div>
<p>Students collect mathematical data and use them to explain worldly phenomenon.
For example, they compare the rate at which Rhinoceros are going extinct
by comparing the numbers of these animals poached over the years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the four year course, Crestans experience the fun in learning
Math, and are equipped with the knowledge and skills for further Mathematical
pursuits. They will also possess the necessary mathematical life-skills
to make good decisions in life, in areas such as making sound financial
choices and improved time management.</p>
