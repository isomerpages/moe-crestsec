<h3>English Language</h3>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>The English Language Department aims to develop Crestans into confident
communicators by infusing a specially curated blended approach into our
curriculum.</p>
<p>We aim for students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>express themselves coherently through speaking and writing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>showcase their strengths and work on areas for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use the language meaningfully in everyday life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inculcate a love for reading</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The four-year programme is designed based on our department’s unique pedagogical
framework which guides us in planning and executing our lessons:</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>reate interest</p>
<p><strong>R</strong>ehearse, Reinforce, Recode</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>xperience</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>tructures</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>ask</p>
<p>Our lessons are thematically designed and cascaded in such a way that
learning is progressive and gradual over the four years. Students are given
the opportunities to hone their language skills in authentic, real-world
contexts such as making small talk in a social setting and checking in
to a hotel through role-play.</p>
<p>In Crest, we believe every student can learn. As such, encouraging formative
assessments form an integral part of the holistic assessments. Engaging
lessons with enriching supporting activities are created to ensure learning
takes place meaningfully.</p>
<p>At the end of four years, all Crestans would be able to communicate confidently
and effectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sec 1 Learning Journey to Yuhua Village gives Secondary One Crestans
the opportunity to explore and familiarise themselves with a local neighbourhood
while practising their English Language skills. In addition to walking
around and discovering various landmarks, students experienced the vibrant
culture of a local hawker centre. This experiential learning activity allowed
them to apply their language skills in real-life situations, helping them
connect more deeply with the community and gain confidence in using English
in everyday contexts.</p>

<p>Students embark on a Learning Journey (LJ) to experience what it is like
to be a tourist in Singapore, taking a river taxi and exploring the iconic
Marina Bay Sands. In addition to enjoying the sights, they interact with
visitors from around the world through an interview activity. This experience
not only exposes them to authentic hospitality and customer service but
also equips them with knowledge that they can apply during Check-in@Crest
as they learn to make recommendations to guests.</p>

<p>Check-In@Crest integrates Secondary 2 students' learning of key communication
skills such as giving directions, offering recommendations, and speaking
in a formal register over three terms, including the 'Tourist for a Day'
learning journey (LJ). Students take on roles as visitor centre officers
and tourists, engaging in meaningful verbal exchanges by providing directions
and recommending local attractions and eateries.</p>

<p><strong>Talk Show (Secondary 3)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Sec 3 Talk Show Project helps students develop interview and audience
engagement skills while further honing their oracy abilities. Through role-playing
as either a host or a guest, students apply techniques learned in class,
including how to engage listeners and use effective questioning. They also
incorporate personal anecdotes, which they've prepared during lessons,
to add depth and authenticity to their responses, enhancing their overall
communication skills.</p>

<p><strong>Theatre Experience (Secondary 3)</strong>

<p>The Sec 3 Theatre Experience immersed students in the world of local theatre
through a blended learning approach. Whether attending a live production
or watching online, students were exposed to the vibrant local theatre
scene. The experience sometimes included a drama workshop, where they learnt
to communicate clearly and confidently through theatre games. The programme
usually concludes with a post-show segment, offering students the unique
opportunity to engage with the playwright and actors, deepening their understanding
of theatrical performance and storytelling.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Food Reviews (Secondary 3)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Sec 3 Food Review Experience offers students the opportunity to combine
learning with a shared dining experience. As a class, they sample a variety
of dishes, fostering camaraderie through food. Following the meal, students
apply their writing skills to craft authentic food reviews and recommendations,
drawing from their firsthand experience to critique the dishes and atmosphere.
This real-world context allows them to refine their descriptive writing
and evaluative skills in a meaningful and enjoyable way.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Oratorical Contest (Secondary 4)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Sec 4 Oratorical Contest challenges students to think on their feet,
sharpening both their critical thinking and oracy skills in preparation
for their oral exams. Contestants compete by delivering impromptu speeches
on a variety of topics, demonstrating their ability to organize thoughts
quickly and present them with confidence. This experience hones their speaking
and presentation abilities while fostering the skills needed to articulate
ideas effectively under pressure.</p>
