### Philosophy

***CRE*ating *S*tudent *T*ransformation (CREST)**

<img src="/images/philo1.jpg" style="width:325px;height:240px;margin-right:25px;" align="left">At Crest Secondary School, our teachers firmly believe that our students have the potential to realise their aspirations, regardless of their backgrounds. We are also cognisant of our students’ diverse learning needs and socio-economic profile, and are committed to equipping them to succeed in school and in life.  

  

The primary objective of the Crest Teaching and Learning Philosophy (TLP) is to guide our teachers in facilitating the transformation of our students into individuals who are grounded in sound character and equipped with the skills for academic progression, employment and adulthood. As our teachers have varied professional experiences, our Crest TLP articulates our professional beliefs and practices as educators to achieve alignment to our school mission.
