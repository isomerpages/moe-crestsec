<p>At Crest Secondary School, REC students dive into the world of <strong>Retail and E-Commerce (REC)</strong>,
learning how to turn ideas into marketable products while embracing creativity,
sustainability, and technology.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Sec 1: Crafty Concoctions</strong>
</p>
<p>In collaboration with the Culinary &amp; Restaurant Operations module,
Secondary 1 students experiment with mocktails, creating signature drinks
and designing branding elements such as names, logos, and labels. They
stage professional product photoshoots to see how presentation and marketing
transform a simple beverage into a sellable product. Using the Cricut,
they add personal touches to produce unique creations, building teamwork,
problem-solving, and self-expression along the way.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 2: Byte-Sized Fun</strong>
</p>
<p>Also in partnership with the Culinary &amp; Restaurant Operations module,
Secondary 2 students turn local and western dishes — like ondeh ondeh,
muah chee, rojak, and chicken chop — into “products” ready for the market.
They explore food styling, professional photography, and digital presentation
using light boxes, textured backdrops, strobes, and LED lights. Products
are uploaded onto a Google site, simulating an e-commerce platform, while
one-minute videos capture their learning journey, blending creativity,
storytelling, and digital skills.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 3: Merchandise Magic</strong>
</p>
<p>Secondary 3 students bring Crest values to life through the Cup Sleeve
Project and Tote Bag Project. Abstract ideas like respect, resilience,
integrity, and teamwork are turned into designs, with students refining
concepts using AI tools to expand creative options and product variations.
They gain hands-on experience in layout, typography, Cricut fabrication,
merchandising, and presenting functional, branded merchandise.</p>

<p>Students embarked on a hands-on learning journey to explore practical
ways to embed sustainability into daily life. They discovered that sustainability
isn’t just a concept — it can be acted upon through conscious material
choices, everyday habits, and creative reuse. A highlight was the upcycling
session, where students transformed old garments and fabrics into new,
functional items, reducing textile waste and conserving resources. By repurposing
instead of discarding, they gained firsthand experience in sustainable
retail practices, understanding how small, creative actions can lessen
environmental impact while shaping a greener, more responsible future for
the fashion industry.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 4: Serve Up RECeption</strong>
</p>
<p>Secondary 4 students lead the Serve Up RECeption, showcasing products
such as tote bags, cup sleeves, coasters, and upcycled wrist straps. They
are taught basic marketing research skills to understand customer preferences
and trends and use AI tools to enhance creativity and tailor offerings.
Students manage customer interactions, demonstrate professionalism, and
practice cross-selling and upselling, all while promoting eco-conscious
products.</p>
<p>Across all levels, students experience the full retail journey — from
product creation, branding, and digital marketing to sales and sustainability.
These projects build confidence, technical skills, and entrepreneurial
thinking, preparing them to become future leaders in sustainable and creative
retail.</p>
