<h3>Retail and eCommerce</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Retail &amp; e-Commerce (REC) is one of the ITE Skills Subjects (ISS)
offered at Crest Secondary School, aimed at equipping students with foundational
skills and knowledge in the retail and e-commerce industry. Students gain
competencies in promoting and selling goods and services, addressing customer
inquiries, assisting customers, arranging merchandise displays, and managing
various retail operations. With the business landscape evolving and online
commerce growing rapidly, students also learn to create digital content,
engage in basic social media marketing, process online orders, and manage
deliveries.</p>

<p>REC collaborates with departments like Culinary &amp; Restaurant Operations
(CRO) to create immersive learning experiences that blend both fields.
This approach helps students see the connections and relevance between
these subjects, building skills that prepare them for future roles in the
retail and e-commerce sectors.</p>

<h4>Ice-Cream Sales</h4>
<p>The ice-cream sales activity offers students the chance to apply key business
and marketing concepts in a real-world context. Students start by learning
how to pack ice cream into cooler boxes, focusing on proper storage and
packaging techniques to ensure product quality. They identify their target
audience and strategically position themselves in high-traffic areas, such
as the school canteen or foyer, to maximise sales.</p>

<p>Customer service is emphasized as students engage with customers in a
friendly manner, build rapport, and encourage repeat business. They practice
clear communication and learn how to present products attractively to capture
customer interest. Teachers observe and assess the students' performance,
which is later discussed in a post-event review for further learning. This
activity provides practical experience in product storage, customer interaction,
and sales techniques, deepening students' understanding of effective product
marketing and sales.</p>
<h4>Crest Harvest Sales</h4>
<p>The Crest Harvest Sales activity is an inter-class competition that uses
a farm-to-table approach, allowing students to apply classroom lessons
in a practical setting. Students pack harvested vegetables in sustainable
packaging that supports recycling and eco-friendly practices—key aspects
of modern business. They design product logos and packaging labels, honing
their branding and design skills while learning how to communicate effectively
with potential customers.</p>

<p>Students create engaging social media posts to showcase the unique features
of their products, such as being locally grown and sustainably packaged.
They learn to adapt their tone and content for their target audiences,
using hashtags, visuals, and captions to maximize visibility. Additionally,
they practice marketing techniques like upselling and cross-selling to
boost sales. The competition incorporates factors such as sales revenue,
marketing strategies, and customer service skills, simulating the competitive
nature of the retail industry. By managing the entire farm-to-table process,
students gain comprehensive product knowledge and hands-on business experience.</p>
<h4>Pick &amp; Mix</h4>
<p>The "Pick &amp; Mix" activity immerses students in retail service through
an intra-class competition where teams compete to run the most popular
cart. Each team curates a product assortment, plans promotions, manages
costs, and handles various retail operations, including packaging, customer
service, cashiering, merchandising, and store management. This activity
offers a comprehensive view of the complexities involved in running a successful
retail setup.</p>

<p>Direct customer interaction helps students enhance their communication
and service skills, and they learn to choose appropriate packaging techniques
that align with product types and customer expectations. Post-sale reviews
focus on packaging quality, customer satisfaction, communication effectiveness,
and operational efficiency. These reflections help students identify strengths
and areas for improvement, reinforcing important lessons for real-world
retail scenarios.</p>
<p>Overall, "Pick &amp; Mix" provides a dynamic learning environment where
students gain insights into customer engagement, operational management,
and strategic thinking in retail.</p>
<h4>Serve Up! Reception</h4>
<p>The Serve Up! Reception event, managed by Secondary Four students, served
as the welcoming point for guests at the annual Serve Up! lunch. Guests
from various industries and organisations were greeted by students, who
demonstrated professionalism and school pride.</p>

<p>The event featured an array of student-created products, including National
Day-themed tote bags, welcome drinks, shrink art school key chains, bracelets
and charms, hydro-dipped photo frames, and artwork developed with guidance
from the Aesthetics Department. Students engaged with guests, explaining
the creative processes behind their products and showcasing their customer
service and communication skills. This experience provided valuable learning
in event management, product presentation, and professional interaction
with school stakeholders, underscoring the importance of representing the
school with pride and professionalism.</p>
