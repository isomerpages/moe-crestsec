<br>Internet of Things Applications (IOTA) is one of the 5 ITE Skills Subjects
(ISS) offered to Secondary 3 and 4 students in Crest Secondary School.
When students select this subject as one of the two Skills Subjects to
study, they will learn the skills and knowledge to deploy Internet of Things
(IoT) technology for a smart home or workplace environment. As Singapore
develops towards smart living and a smart nation, taking this subject will
allow the students to understand how IoT works and develop students’ interest
in post-secondary electronic-based education. Students who obtain a pass
in this NT equivalent subject will be considered to have passed a science
equivalent subject when applying to ITE courses.&nbsp;</p>
