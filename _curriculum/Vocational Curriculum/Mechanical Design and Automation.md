<p>Mechanical Design &amp; Automation (MDA) is one of the 5 ITE Skills Subjects
(ISS) offered to Secondary 3 and 4 students in Crest Secondary School.&nbsp;
When students select this subject as one of the two Skills Subjects to
study, they will learn skills and knowledge in designing, making and assembling
parts to form simple movable products. They will design simple 3D products,
create the 3D models and 3D print the prototypes. They will also perform
basic mechanical fitting work and assembly, and assemble parts and components
to complete an automated pneumatic system. Students who obtain a pass in
this NT equivalent subject will be considered to have passed a science
equivalent subject when applying to ITE courses.</p>

<p>MDA trains students to observe and identify work hazards, and understand
the proper use of personal protection equipment. It aims to equip students
with skills and knowledge of machines and mechanism, and develop studentsâ€™
interest in a post-secondary engineering-based education.</p>
