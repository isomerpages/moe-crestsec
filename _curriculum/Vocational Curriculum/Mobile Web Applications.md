<p>Mobile Web Applications (MWA) is one of the 5 ITE Skills Subjects (ISS)
offered to Secondary 3 and 4 students in Crest Secondary School. When students
select this subject as one of the two Skills Subjects to study, they will
learn how to develop rich user interface and responsive mobile web applications
for common mobile devices. Upper Secondary students develop interactive
web pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They also develop interactive
web applications using Adobe Animate. Students who obtain a pass in this
NT equivalent subject will be considered to have passed a science equivalent
subject when applying to ITE courses.</p>
