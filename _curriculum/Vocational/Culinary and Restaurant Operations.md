</div>
<p>Culinary &amp; Restaurant Operations (CRO) is one of the five ITE Skills
Subjects (ISS) offered to Secondary 3 and Secondary 4 students in Crest
Secondary School. When students select this subject as one of the two Skills
Subjects to study, they will learn the basic skills and knowledge of the
vibrant and rewarding hospitality industry.</p>
<p>CRO students will get intensive hands-on learning in two core areas. These
are culinary skills and food and beverage service. Students will get to
develop their skills in learning spaces such as the school’s training kitchens
and bistro. They will get to prepare and serve food to real customers.
Their skill sets will be further deepened with a 4-week industry experiential
programme at leading hotels and restaurants.</p>

<h4>Serve Up!</h4>
<p>Modelled after a casual dining concept, this signature programme is a
collaborative effort by the CRO students. Staff and partners are invited
for a two-course set meal cooked by the students. This allows the students
to practice what they have learnt in an authentic, non-scripted environment.</p>

<p>Modelled after a casual dining establishment, this is an authentic learning
event where the CRO students cook and serve simple fare from an ala carte
menu, to guests who are usually our own school staff. This allows the students
to put into practice what they have learnt and acts as a lead-up to the
Authentic Lunches.</p>
