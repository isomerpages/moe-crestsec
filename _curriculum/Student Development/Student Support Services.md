<h4>Objective</h4>

<p>Our department is a conglomeration of helping professionals consisting
of Counsellors, Student Welfare Officers and Special Educational Needs
Officers. As a synergised team, we seek to address the diverse learning
and social-emotional needs of the student population at Crest Secondary
School. Beyond co-constructing solutions with students for their immediate
challenges, the Student Support Services aims to fortify the character
and competencies of our students as they trek towards young-adulthood.</p>
<h4>Counselling Support</h4>

</div>
<p>School Counsellors in Crest Secondary play an integral role in supporting
the social, mental and emotional well-being of Crestans. As Crestans forge
ahead in their quest for self-discovery, personal development and fulfillment,
we as School Counsellors journey alongside them, providing essential skills
and competencies needed to cope with and overcome life's challenges resiliently.
Some of the key services we provide are:</p>
<p>1) Individual and Group counselling</p>
<p>2) Psychoeducation on mental, emotional and social well-being</p>
<p>3) Workshops and activities that suit the needs of students (self-esteem,
communication skills, coping strategies, etc.).</p>
<p>4) Referrals to external agencies e.g. youth mental health services and
family services centres.</p>
<p>As an expression of our indispensable partnership with parents/care-givers,
we have consolidated some parenting resources for easy access (<a href="https://sites.google.com/crestsec.edu.sg/resourcesforparents" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/crestsec.edu.sg/resourcesforparents</a>).</p>
<h4>Special Educational Needs Support</h4>

<p>Special Educational Needs (SEN) Officers work collaboratively with key
stakeholders such as parents, teachers, school leadership team, and professionals
to maximize the potential of Crestans with mild SEN. Our passion working
with young persons with SEN puts them at the heart of everything we do.
We strive to create an inclusive school system, systematize and coordinate
various levels of support, and design customized intervention (individual/group)
to equip our students with skills beyond the secondary school years. Some
