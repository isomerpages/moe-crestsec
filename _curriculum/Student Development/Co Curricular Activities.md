Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) is a key platform for character development and inculcation of values and talent development. These activities range from training sessions and team bonding camps, to external platforms for talent showcase. Crest believes that with an exciting CCA programme, students will have a positive schooling experience.

In Crest, CCAs provide opportunities for social interaction as the activities encourage both racial and gender. Students learn to respect each other and enjoy each other’s company whilst going through the activities together. CCAs are also wonderful excellent platforms for the students to learn about leadership. The students will learn how to lead others and how to be a good team player.

Through the four-year CCA programme, Crest hopes to inspire Crestans to scale greater heights and to expand their horizon, on top of acquiring the necessary skills, values and competencies which they can apply in their daily lives.
