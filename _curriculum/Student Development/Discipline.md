<p>In line with MOE’s positive and proactive approach to discipline, Crest
Secondary School believes that students learn best in a caring and conducive
environment where there is order and discipline, yet at the same time encouragement
and space for students to learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p>We believe that discipline is an iterative educational process, where
our goal is to instil self-discipline and good character in our students,
underpinned by the right values and social-emotional skills. It is thus
necessary to mete out consequences for any inappropriate behaviour fairly,
firmly and in a timely manner. At the same time, it is important to restore
our students through restitution (fixing the problem), resolution (ensuring
the problem does not happen again) and reconciliation (healing of relationships).</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, the Discipline Committee works very closely
with the Year Head Team and the Student Support Department on the following
three processes:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Promote &amp; Prevent.</strong>&nbsp;At
the core of effective discipline is strong teacher-student relationships.
Through promoting a safe and supportive environment and a culture of care,
we will be able to strengthen protective factors and minimise risk factors
to prevent challenging behaviours from occurring.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Address and Correct.</strong>&nbsp;When
students display inappropriate behaviour, it is important to address this
behaviour promptly, and to correct it before it affects the development
and well-being of themselves or their peers. It is also important to address
the underlying reason for the inappropriate behaviour in order to achieve
sustainable behavioural change.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Replace and Restore.</strong>&nbsp;As
the ultimate goal is for students to develop self-discipline, good character
and the right values, it is important to replace the inappropriate behaviour
with prosocial, appropriate behaviour instead, and to restore their relationships
with those who may have been hurt by their inappropriate actions. Through
the consistent reinforcement of prosocial, appropriate behaviour, we will
be able to encourage the formation of positive behavioural habits instead.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe very strongly in the importance of the school working
closely and collaboratively with the family in order to achieve the best
outcomes for our students. To this end, we maintain close communication
with parents regarding any inappropriate behaviour, and proactively engage
parents to understand the situation better and co-create strategies to
guide and support our students.</p>
