<h3>Character and Citizenship Education</h3>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>The primary objective of Crest’s&nbsp;<strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Programme</strong>&nbsp;is
to support the holistic development of Crestans, anchored on the school
values of Integrity, Care, Resilience, Excellence, Self-worth and Teamwork&nbsp;<strong>(i-CREST)</strong>.
As they progress from Sec 1 to Sec 4, they develop social-emotional and
21st century competencies, as well as positive work habits that enable
them to serve and make a difference in the lives of others.</p>
<p>The specific objectives of CCE are for Crestans to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop as concerned citizens, imbued with a strong sense of national
identity and pride;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be able to reflect on and respond to community, national and global issues,
and to make informed and responsible decisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show kindness and goodwill towards others, standing up for what is right
and taking actions to help others; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect with others in fostering harmony to build an inclusive community.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>CCE is enacted intentionally through learning platforms such as CCE Lessons
and key Student Development Experiences such as Education and Career Guidance
(ECG) and Values-in-Action (VIA) programme. An important curriculum is
the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People which forms the broad mindsets
and skills Crestans adopt to achieve success in their daily lives. Four
NE events are commemorated every year, Total Defence Day, International
Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day.</p>

<p><strong>Values-In-Action (VIA)</strong>&nbsp;is an important CCE component
where our students learn to make a difference in the community. An example
of VIA is Sparkle where classes are assigned time to clean the school and&nbsp;classroom
because a family takes ownership of the cleanliness of their living and
learning space. The secondary four classes also adopt a beneficiary of
their choice and implement their project as a class.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Character Development through Customised CCE Programmes</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Crest Domino Challenge (Secondary 1 and 2)</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are challenged to complete a domino pattern based on a theme,
and through the process hone their social-emotional competencies under
stressful conditions (e.g. time constraint) in a safe and controlled learning
environment. The level of difficulty increases from Secondary 1 to 2 as
the latter includes building vertical towers (on top of the horizontal
chains) as well as random injected scenarios to challenge students’ ability
to react to changes while sticking to the goal of building the domino pattern.
The teacher facilitators note the social-emotional interactions during
the challenge and raise the observations in the classroom for reflections.</p>

</p>
<p>Ohana means ‘Family’, and ‘Family’ means no one gets left behind or forgotten.
This is the name given to our Form Teacher interaction time for classes
to build stronger ties among themselves and also with their form teachers.
Teachers and students are empowered to carry out activities such as classroom
decorations, celebrations and bonding games to build the relationships
in their second home and family.</p>
