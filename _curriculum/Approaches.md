<h3>Curriculum Approaches</h3>
<p><strong>Hands-On, Skills-Based, Practice-Oriented</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authentic settings are deliberately scheduled to allow students to apply
and showcase their learning, and to anchor assessment and feedback on observable
actions. Learning is situated in immersive real-world settings via the
school’s unique vocational training facilities to deepen students’ appreciation
of the relevance of the learning.</p>

<p><strong>Creative Integration of Academic and Vocational Subjects to Strengthen</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Literacy and Numeracy</strong>
</p>
<p>By integrating the academic and vocational curricula through the experiential
learning of academic topics and skills in vocational settings, students
are able to appreciate the functional use of English and Mathematics.</p>

<p><strong>Strengthening 3R through Engagement in Art and Aesthetics</strong>
</p>
<p>The Arts and Aesthetics programmes within the formal curriculum tap into
the students’ affective domain to motivate them to come to school, by engaging
them in fun activities that would enrich their schooling experience, enabling
them to hone personal life skills. Participation in such activities also
builds students’ resilience and self-worth through experiencing success
in a fun manner.</p>
