<p style="text-align: left;">Words like ‘big data analytics’ and ‘drone technology’ might be daunting to most youths. However this is not the case for the participants of the IgnITE Skills Challenge. The competition, which is organised by the Institute Technical of Education (ITE), is the only competition which assesses the skills of students who are in the Normal streams. 
Crest has been sending our students across all levels to this yearly competition to showcase their skills and teamwork, and encourage them to be innovative. Our students also gained valuable experience from interacting with their competitors and widen their exposure on the skills standards beyond Crest.</p>
