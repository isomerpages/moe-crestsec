At Crest Secondary School, we have an integrated and authentic Total Curriculum that is student-centric and values-focused. Crest offers a unique skills-based, practice-oriented curriculum that is a hybrid of an academic and vocational programme in order to achieve both engaged learning and meaningful schooling for our students. All this is underpinned by our student development programme, which nurtures in our students sound values, good character and strong social-emotional skills.
