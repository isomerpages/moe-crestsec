Overseas Learning Journey
-------------------------

<img src="/images/stp1.png" style="width:100%">

To broaden their understanding of the world beyond Singapore, our Secondary 3 Crestans are sent on an Overseas Learning Journey (OLJ) to ASEAN countries. Over the four to five days spent overseas, Crestans are immersed in the culture and appreciate the history, arts and food of our ASEAN neighbours.   

With ASEAN developing, many opportunities for enterprise, innovation and knowledge will open up. It is with this hope that we actively send our Crestans overseas to interact with ASEAN students to learn how to interact with people from different cultural and geographic backgrounds. In the future, they would then be comfortable to engage the global world in their collaboration with people from different countries.
