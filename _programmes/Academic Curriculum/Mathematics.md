Objective
---------

The Mathematics Department pedagogical framework is designed to reboot, recondition and restore Crestans’ confidence for Mathematics through positive teacher-student relationship and effective teaching strategies. 

Curriculum
----------

Apart from effective classroom learning activities, we structure hands-on activities into our Curriculum to allow our Crestans apply their mathematical concepts. We also do inter-departmental collaborations to let students learn about the world around them through Mathematics, and to promote the joy of learning in Crestans.

Secondary One (A Collaboration with Retail Services Department)

Bubble Tea Making in Secondary Two (A Collaboration with Culinary and Restaurant Operations Department)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Learning Journey to Gardens by the Bay in Secondary Two (A Collaboration with English Department)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<img src="/images/m3.jpg" style="width:325px;height:240px;margin-right:25px;" align = "left">Students make measurements and apply their mathematical concepts to see the world through the mathematical lens. For example, they measure the radii and circumference of circles, then compare the calculated circumference against the measured circumference.

Learning Journey to Singapore Zoo in Secondary Three (A Collaboration with English Department)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<img src="/images/m4.jpg" style="width:325px;height:240px;margin-right:25px;" align = "left">Students collect mathematical data and use them to explain worldly phenomenon. For example, they compare the rate at which Rhinoceros are going extinct by comparing the numbers of these animals poached over the years. 

At the end of the four year course, Crestans experience the fun in learning Math, and are equipped with the knowledge and skills for further Mathematical pursuits. They will also possess the necessary mathematical life-skills to make good decisions in life, in areas such as making sound financial choices and improved time management.
