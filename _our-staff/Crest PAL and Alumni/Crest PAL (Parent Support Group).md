<p><em>Crest PAL is the Parent Support Group (PSG) of&nbsp;Crest, ‘PAL’ stands for ‘Parents’ Active Link’, and as our name suggests, we aim to bring parents together, support one another on the journey of parenting, and work with our teachers to support their children’s education. All our students’ parents/guardians are part of the Crest PAL community.<br></em>

<p><em>The school works with the Crest PAL ExCo to organize activities for all parents such as parents’ dialogues and parenting workshops. Other activities include learning journeys, as well as sports and games to promote parent-child interaction and bonding. Some examples include laser tag, archery tag, soccer, bowling, cooking, baking, pizza making, learning journeys to farms etc.<br>Over the years, we have parents who volunteer actively in our school events, such as the Education and Career Guidance (ECG) fair, Open House and Cross Country Run. We certainly welcome more parents to join us!</em>

<p><em>"Cahaya was a quiet girl in primary school. Ever since she joined Crest, I see a change in her, especially in her outlook towards studies. Her mother also observed that Cahaya’s confidence level is higher now. One thing which surprised us was when Cahaya took the initiative to cook for us. Now, I see an independent and responsible girl.”</em>
<br><strong>- Mr Mohamad Noor</strong>
</p>
<p><em>"The teachers at Crest are really passionate and caring! I appreciate that they go out of the way to keep us informed of our child’s progress. The parent-child bonding activities have most certainly brought me closer to my child."</em>
<br><strong>-&nbsp;Mdm Sharon Tan</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>“I feel that Crest Secondary is best suited for the students because of the unique curriculum that allows for more experiential learning beyond the classroom. I also like the culture of the school where emphasis is on character building and teamwork.”</em>
<br><strong>-&nbsp;Mdm Fanny Cheong</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Serving as a parent volunteer in Crest is my way of expressing my gratitude to the teachers of Crest. They have given my children not just a holistic Secondary School education but also given them back their confidence, self-esteem and identity. Through Crest, my children have grown to be independent learners and responsible youths. This is because Crest teachers teach with their heart.</em>
