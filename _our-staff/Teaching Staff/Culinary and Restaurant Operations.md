#### Objective

<img src="/images/cr01.jpg" style="width:75%"> 

Culinary and Restaurant Operations (CRO) is one of the five ITE Skills Subjects (ISS) offered to Secondary 3 and Secondary 4 students in Crest Secondary School. When students select this subject as one of the two Skills Subjects to study, they will learn the basic skills and knowledge of the vibrant and rewarding hospitality industry.

CRO students will get intensive hands-on learning in two core areas. These are culinary skills and food and beverage service. Students will get to develop their skills in authentic learning spaces such as the school’s training kitchens and bistro. They will get to prepare and serve food to real customers. Their skill sets will be further deepened with a 4-week industry experiential programme at leading hotels &amp; restaurants.

In order for the students to discover if they are suitable and have an interest in this subject, they will be expose to compulsory taster modules in Secondary 1 and 2. Details of the taster modules are as shown below.

#### Taster Modules

Curriculum for the lower secondary levels involves two foundation modules to equip students with basic food preparation, as well as, food and beverage skills and knowledge.

| Taster Module | Description |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Passion to Serve | This module is taught in Secondary 1. In this module, students will learn about basic food handling and hygiene. They will be introduced to the basics of Food and Beverage services, including making of mocktails. |  |  |
| Looks Good Tastes Good | This module is taught in Secondary 2. In this module, students will learn about kitchen safety and hygiene. They will be trained in basic cutting and food preparation skills |  |  |

#### Authentic Lunch

Modelled after a fine dining concept, this signature programme is a collaborative effort by Secondary 3 and 4 Culinary and Restaurant Operations students. Staff and partners are invited for a two-course set meal cooked by the Secondary 3 and served by the Secondary 4 students. This allows the students to practice what they have learnt in an authentic, non-scripted environment.

#### Makan @ Bistro

<img src="/images/cro4.jpg" style="width:285px;height:240px;margin-right:25px;" align="left">Modelled after a casual dining establishment, this is an authentic learning event where the Secondary 4 Culinary and Restaurant Operations students cook and serve simple fare from an ala carte menu, to guests who are usually our own school staff. This allows the students to put into practice what they have learnt and acts as a lead-up to the Authentic Lunches.
