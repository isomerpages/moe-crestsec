<h4>Information on Results Collection</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Dear Crestans and Parents/Guardians of the 2024 Graduating Cohort,</p>
<p>MOE and SEAB have announced that the GCE N-Level Examination results will
be released on <strong>Mon, 16 December 2024 at 2 pm</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crestans are reminded to be properly groomed and dressed in their school
attire. Crestans can report to the School Hall at 1.45 pm on 16 December
2024 to collect their results. Parents/Guardians may accompany their child/ward
to the school to collect their results.</p>
<p>Crestans who are unable to collect their results in person should inform
the school through their Form Teacher, and can appoint a proxy (Parent/
Guardian) to collect a physical copy of their results on their behalf.
Proxies can proceed to the school ballot&nbsp; collect the results on the
actual day.&nbsp; Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents
(Photo ID of the students and proxies for identification) for the school’s
verification when collecting the results. School candidates may contact
the school through their Form Teacher for assistance if candidates are
unable to appoint a proxy. Please do so before 16 Dec 2024.</p>
