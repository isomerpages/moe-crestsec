### Yuhua Community

We believe every Crestan can contribute to the community. Over the years, the Yuhua community has provided Crestans with bountiful opportunities to contribute to the community through the various events such as Prosperity Rice Distribution, Chinese New Year Celebration Dinner, National Day Observance Ceremony and PAssionArts event.

**Mega Toss 2020 (CNY Celebration Dinner)**

It was the first time they performed for such an event and they were deeply encouraged by the positive affirmation from the audience. The dancers look forward to stage more dance performances to contribute to the Yuhua community.

We are grateful for the opportunity to interact with the seniors in our community!

**National Day Observance**

Girl Guides and Scouts commemorate the national spirit of aspiration and perseverance with the Yuhua community as they participated in the National Day Observance Ceremony. They were part of the marching contingent with students from other schools.

**PAssionArts Festival**

In 2019, they embarked on the ‘Garden of HeArts’ project to promote the awareness of the Arts within the Yuhua Community. The entire Sec One level was involved in the creation of ‘Garden of HeArts’, which is a display of heart-shaped standees designed and painted by them. Their collective efforts boosted their self-worth and gave them a sense of belonging to the school.

The Visual Arts student artists also painted hand in hand with the Art Practitioners for the Plank Art programme. They had the chance to observe the works of the Art Practitioners, who served as role models in artmaking.

These experiences gave them a chance to understand the role of the arts and the art community, and such authentic learning experiences are not duplicable in the school-learning context. By broadening their exposure, they will have more opportunities to learn about what they are good at.

**Leadership Training Programme**

Every year, Crest Secondary School nominates promising Sec 2 students from our various CCAs to attend this 2-day day camp, organised and led by student mentors from JPJC.

It presents an excellent platform for Crestans to interact, exchange ideas and bond with peers from schools such as JPJC, Commonwealth and Yuan Ching Secondary Schools.
