<h4>Secondary 2: Recondition – Discovering Passions, Strengthening Connections</h4>
<p>At Secondary 2, our students embark on a transformative journey of self-discovery
and connection-building that lies at the heart of our school's mission
to develop students of values and character who make a difference in the
community. The "Recondition" theme reflects this pivotal year where students
reshape their understanding of themselves, their interests, and their place
in both local and global communities.</p>
<p>Through carefully designed experiences, our Sec 2 students develop quality
relationships that extend beyond classroom walls. The year's programme
creates meaningful opportunities for students to strengthen connections
with peers and the diverse communities as well as discovering their unique
passions and potential pathways.</p>
<p>Our GOAL (Go Overseas and Learn) programme takes students beyond Singapore's
shores for an immersive cultural experience that broadens perspectives
and builds global awareness. Students return with enhanced empathy, cultural
sensitivity, and a deeper appreciation for diversity. These qualities help
to strengthen their abilities to contribute meaningfully to our multicultural
society.</p>

<p>Complementing the international exposure, our Experience ITE Programme
provides students with hands-on insights into technical education pathways.
Through practical workshops and skill-based activities, students explore
various ITE subjects, helping them make informed decisions about their
academic journey and discovering potential areas of their passion and aptitude.</p>

<p>These experiences are delivered within our commitment to maintaining a
safe, conducive, and inclusive environment where every student feels valued
and supported. As students navigate new challenges and opportunities, they
develop healthy emotional regulation skills that serve them throughout
their educational journey and beyond.</p>

difference in the world.</p>
