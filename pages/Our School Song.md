**Verse 1:**

_I have found a place_<br>
_Where my heart is free to dream_<br>
_It's here that I belong_<br>
_Where strength rises from within_<br>
_All the things I hope for_<br>
_They're mine to strive for_<br>
_I'll rise up to the challenge_<br>
_To turn my dreams into reality_


**Chorus:**

_I know I can_<br>
_I'm reaching high_<br>
_To touch the sky_<br>
_I'm not afraid to try_<br>
_To realise my dreams_<br>
_Upon this Crest_<br>
_I'll do my best_<br>
_To be all that I was meant to be_<br>
_I'll shout it to the world_<br>
_I know I can_


  

  

**Verse 2:**


_The road will not be easy_<br>
_But no matter how long it seems_<br>
_I'll just keep walking on_<br>
_I'll never give up on my dreams_<br>
_There'll always be a helping hand_<br>
_And someone who will be a friend_<br>
_In this place that feels like home_<br>
_I know I'll never have to walk alone_

  

**(Chorus x 2)**

**Composed By**

**Mr Adrian Tay and Mr Matthias Chua**
