<h4>Handbrake Requirement for Bicycles</h4>
<p>Dear parent/guardian,</p>
<p>Over the past few years, we have seen an increase in the number of people
using bicycles as a mode of transport or for leisure, especially since
the COVID-19 pandemic. This may include students who cycle to and from
school, or during the weekends with friends and families. Some of these
students who cycle may be fixie enthusiasts. Fixies, also known as fixed-gear
bicycles, generally do not have hand-operated brakes, but instead, rely
on the rider’s pedal resistance to stop. This makes it challenging for
riders to brake quickly, endangering themselves and other path and road
users.</p>
<p>To improve safety, from 1 September 2021, all bicycles are ridden on public
paths and roads must have at least one functioning handbrake.</p>
<p>Please see LTA’s Facebook post and poster on this new rule for your information.
We also wish to inform parents that students may only be allowed to cycle
to school with their parents’ knowledge through a parents’ advisory note.
Students who cycle to school should also wear protective gear, such as
a helmet, and have a bicycle lock to secure their bicycles at the bicycle
racks.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>2. For general enquiries, please contact the Admin Office at 6899 2779
or email info@crestsec.edu.sg, our Administration Staff would be glad to
assist you. If there are any urgent messages during school hours, we advise
parents to contact the Admin Office, as teachers may have lessons or engage
in other official duties.</p>
<p>3. To ensure quality time for our teachers to rest and recharge, we seek
the kind cooperation of parents to limit communication with teachers within
school operating hours (7.30 am to 5.30 pm) on working weekdays and during
school term. Teachers are not expected to respond to parents’ and/or students’
queries after school operating hours, during weekends and on school and
public holidays, though this can be on a case-by-case basis, depending
on the urgency of the matter.</p>
<p>4. Please note that teachers are not obliged to share their personal phone
numbers to parents or students. Parents may wish to discuss with your child’s
teacher what his/her preferred mode of communication is.</p>
<p>5. Parents may expect to receive a response to their email queries within
3 working days. Our staff’s email addresses are available on the school
website.</p>
<p>6. If parents wish to meet our teachers face-to-face or virtually kindly
email the teacher(s) or contact the Admin Office to make an appointment
in advance, to minimize disruption to teachers’ teaching duties and avoid
wait time.</p>
