<p>I used to be very shy and introverted, but Crest has helped me to step
out of my comfort zone and be the confident person I am today. Through
the four years in Crest, I have learnt to be more resilient and not give
up when I face challenges. Without Crest, I would not be who I am today.</p>

<p>Crest has given me many opportunities to grow and I had many new experiences
in Crest. The most memorable one was my first overseas trip with the school.
It was my first time on an airplane and away from home without my parents.
I learnt to be independent and work with others to achieve a common goal
through this trip. The teachers in Crest are also very supportive. They
constantly encouraged me not to give up and gave me practical advice to
put my problems aside so that I can focus on my studies.</p>

<p>I have many fond memories in Crest, especially the time spent with my
teachers. I feel at ease when I talk to them and I can even crack jokes
around them. I hope to be like my teachers, to be that positive influence
to my juniors. That is why I volunteered to come back during the Secondary
1 orientation to help out.</p>

<p><strong>Why did you join Crest Alumni?</strong>
</p>
<p>I am proud to be a part of Crest Alumni and that is why I came back to
help as a guide during the Crest Open House. The two other activities that
I enjoyed most as an alumnus are the Alumni Appreciation Dinner and Secondary
1 orientation programme where I had the opportunity to interact with my
juniors and catch up with old friends.</p>
