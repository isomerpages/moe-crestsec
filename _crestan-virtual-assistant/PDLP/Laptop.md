Acer TMP214-53

**Purchase price: S$826.00 for 3-year warranty and insurance**

***

After much deliberation from a list of devices available for schools to choose from, we have decided to use Acer TMP214 as the main computing device for our students. This is due to several factors:

*   It is a Windows laptop as some software used in Vocational subjects are only available in Windows.
    
*   The specifications have at least i5 Intel processor chip, 8GB RAM and SSD. This will allow for Device Management App (DMA) to run in the background without experiencing slow-down in performance for students.
    
*   It is affordable for students and their families.
