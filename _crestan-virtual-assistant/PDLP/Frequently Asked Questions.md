Device Purchase
--------------------

Please read through some of the common questions that were asked. If you have any further questions, please key them in here:

**1) If student has already bought a laptop from NEUPC-Plus program, can he still buy from PDLP?**

School to assess if the NEU PC Plus devices are suitable for learning in school (when used alongside the school's prescribed device). If unsuitable, then school can let student to purchase another device under PDLP and provide the student with the required subsidy.

**2) Can my child not purchase the device?**

Every student is required to have a device for teaching and learning purposes and is encouraged to purchase one through the school via MOE’s bulk tender. Students are encouraged to use the device model prescribed by the school, as the uniformity of systems and software would ensure a smooth learning experience for everyone. The device purchased through the school will come with the necessary warranty and insurance as well.

Students who do not wish to purchase a device because they already have their own devices will have to check with the school to ascertain whether the specifications of their existing devices meet the schools’ requirements. These existing devices must also be installed with a Device Management Application (DMA) software to manage the student’s access and usage.

**3) If a student has recently bought a new laptop himself, can he use that for PDLP and install DMA inside?**

For students who wish to use their own devices, these devices must meet the necessary specifications such as processor speed and compatibility with the school’s DMA. Schools will need to arrange for students to bring their devices in for installation. If the devices are not compatible with the school’s DMA, it will likely be due to different OS, school will have to decide if students can use devices of different OS.

**4) What will happen to the laptop if I were to use my own laptop instead of purchasing one through PDLP?**

Your laptop will be wiped out to factory settings. Meaning all data inside will be lost. Then installation of DMA and other necessary software will be installed into your laptop. With the DMA installed, teachers are able to control usage of your laptop depending on circumstances.

**5) My child loaned a device from the school for Home-Based Learning (HBL). Can he/she continue to use the loaned device instead of purchasing a new one?**

Students are encouraged to use the device model prescribed by the school under the PLD initiative, as the uniformity of systems and software would ensure a smooth learning experience for them. The devices will be used both in and out of class. In class, the devices will be used to support learning of the curriculum subjects independently or collaboratively. Beyond the classroom, students will be able to use the device for home-based learning.

Devices purchased under the PLD initiative belong to the students, and they can continue to use the devices after graduation. For students who are receiving financial assistance, they will be provided additional subsidies such that their out-of-pocket expenses for the device will be zero.

**6) Do all students in a school have to use the same device? What about students who opt out of using the school-selected device and wish to use their own? How will this affect their learning?**

Students are encouraged to use the model prescribed by the school for a smooth learning experience. If students wish to use their own devices, these devices must meet the necessary specifications stated by the school. They must also be willing to allow the school to install Device Management Application software to manage the device, similar to all school-selected devices. If parents have questions about the devices, they can approach their child’s teachers or school leaders for assistance.

**7) If my child decides to use his own laptop for lessons in school, what are the minimum specifications needed for the laptop?**

Preferably, the laptop should not be more than 3 years old and it has Windows 10 installed in it currently. This will signify that the hardware specifications of the laptop is still quite recent.

Device Care
--------------------

**1) Are there lockers for students?**

Lockers will be installed in locations such as viewing gallery, futsal court, MPH and ISH where classes such as PE will be carried out. Students can use them while having PE. There are lockers in the classrooms as well that students can use. However, at all other times, students are expected to carry the laptops with them wherever they go.

**2) Will my child be allowed to store the device in school overnight?**

Students should bring home the devices at the end of the school day so that they can utilise them for learning at home. Laptops are NOT allowed to be left overnight in school.


Device Usage
--------------------

**1) Is there any help from MOE for students with no internet connectivity at home?**

While secondary school students who are in PDLP schools cannot apply for devices or broadband connectivity under NEU PC Plus, MOE will work with IMDA to provide broadband for eligible students from low income households. Additionally, students can always make use of the free internet access available in school.

**2) What happens to the device after my child graduates?**

The school will uninstall the DMA from the devices upon students’ graduation, and students will have full control and personal ownership over their devices afterwards. If the student’s device needs to be installed with DMA in JC/MI, it can be reinstated.

**3) Will the devices and SLS resources replace textbooks?**

With the devices, students can now access curriculum-aligned resources in the SLS both in and outside of class at their own pace, to complement their learning. The devices and SLS resources will not replace textbooks, as textbooks are currently designed as curriculum-aligned reference for students.

**4) Will my child need to purchase software for their devices? If so, can these be paid for with Edusave?**

The school may prescribe software that support the teaching and learning requirements. However, Edusave cannot be used for purchase of software (and relevant licences).

To support the development of digital literacy, MOE will also be rolling out the following applications in the Personal Learning Devices in early 2021: Google Suite for Education, Microsoft Office productivity suite which includes only Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote & Publisher, and Zoom.

**5) How frequently will the devices be used in class? Is there a recommended limit to screen time in class?**

There is no recommended screen time as it depends very much on the nature of the activity. According to the American Academy of Paediatrics (2016), there is no one-size-fits-all approach to limiting the amount of screen time for teenagers. The academy recommends that screen time takes into consideration a child’s developmental stage, how the technology is used, the quality of the content and design of the material. Schools will design their learning programmes to ensure that the students’ use of PLDs is balanced in relation to other activities and modes of learning.

However, all PLDs will be installed with DMA, which allows teachers to manage students’ screen time if they so desire. Teachers will also continue to ensure that the amount of assignments set (both online and offline) is guided by the school’s homework policy.
