There are times when the laptop doesn't work the way we want it to be. We have listed the common problems that students usually face and the accompanying solutions here. Please refer to this if you need help.


Should the problems not be resolved, please ask the students to proceed to ICT Helpdesk in our school library for our desktop engineers to take a look.


### 

**Check 1: If student's PLD cannot be turned on, check the power light beside the power button (right side of the laptop).**

If the power light is flashing slowly, that means it is in hibernation mode. Press and hold down the power button for about 2 minutes, until you see the laptop turns on.


Please remind student to ensure the laptop is shut down fully before closing the lid. If not, the laptop might go into hibernation mode.

Many times they are connected to pldsetup@SSOE which is the wrong SSID to connect to. This will prevent them from accessing websites.

**Problems:**

* **Keyboard is not working.**
    
* **Brightness level of screen cannot be adjusted.**
    

**Solution:**

Restart the laptop. It should work after that.


**Problem:**

**Student's home laptop cannot connect to school's SWN@SSOE network even after resetting student's MIMS password.**


**Solution:**


SWN@SSOE network requires student's MIMS password to login. Should student forget his password, and MIMS administrator have reset for him, student will still need to log in to his MIMS account using the temporary password, change to his own password, then use this new password to login to the network.


###

It should open after these steps.

**Problem:**
