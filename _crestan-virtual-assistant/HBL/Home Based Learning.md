### 

**What is Home-Based Learning (HBL)?**

Home-based learning is where students will have their lessons and do their learning at home. Learning at home can be a combination of Zoom 'live' lessons and/or doing their pen and paper practices on their own.

Not every home-based lesson requires use of laptop. In fact, teachers will plan such that there is pen and paper work, mixed with use of laptops when necessary, especially when it will help to enhance learning greatly.

HBL is beneficial to students to encourage them to be more independent in their learning, to practise good time management and to regulate themselves to be responsible to finish the day's work assigned to them. These are the important life skills that will serve them well into their working lives.

**Lesson coverage in HBL days**

<u>Curriculum Coverage</u>

Every subject will be involved in HBL except CCE subjects such as Ohana, SELF and NICE in a year. Students will access the [HBL Task Sheet (Google Sheet)](https://sites.google.com/crestsec.edu.sg/pdlpmicrosite/hbl/hbl-instructions) online for the day's lesson instructions provided by their subject teachers. Students would need to actively plan for their day and practise good time management as one of the key purpose of HBL is to encourage independence and self-directedness in their learning.

  

<u>Student-Initiated Learning (SIL)</u>

We encourage students to learn beyond the formal curriculum to explore a strength or an area of interest through SIL activities. Students can choose their activity from a school-curated list of activities or to choose an activity independently. Please see the infographic below.

Students will be encouraged to reflect on their learning experience in an online journal after conducting their SIL activity.
