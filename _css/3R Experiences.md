### 3R Experiences

In our school, we believe in the 3R mission for our students. The 3R stands for:

*   **Reboot** our students’ learning experiences and taste success,
*   **Recondition** our students’ habits toward self-discipline,
*   **Restore** our students’ self-confidence, self-esteem and self-worth.  
   

All decisions made and programs created in school are geared toward the 3R mission. Some these programs include:

#### WHOLE SCHOOL APPROACH TO STUDENT DEVELOPMENT

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People form the broad mindsets and skills Crestans should adopt to achieve private and public victory. This is the whole school approach that the Student Development Team has adopted.

#### BEST OF CREST

This platform allows our students to showcase the different talents they have, be it bicycle stunts, yoyo skills or gaming. We recognise that all students are different and the different skills that they have outside academia. Students will showcase their talents to the entire school during morning assemblies.

#### BACK TO SCHOOL

Back To School (BTS) Programme was designed to motivate identified students who have attendance issues to attend and enjoy school regularly with the support of their peers and teacher-mentors. Through this programme, they discover their true self (Values, Interests, Personality & Skills) through our school-wide engagement and targeted programs.
