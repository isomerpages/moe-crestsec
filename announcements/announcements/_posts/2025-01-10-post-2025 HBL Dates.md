<p>Dear Parent/Guardian,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Home-based learning (HBL) refers to a structured approach where students
continue their education from home, typically through a combination of
online lessons and independent assignments. During HBL, students engage
in live virtual classes and complete tasks such as worksheets or projects
at their own pace. This approach is designed to ensure that learning remains
consistent, even outside the classroom, while fostering greater student
autonomy. Teachers tailor lessons to include a blend of digital tools and
traditional methods, ensuring that students gain a well-rounded education.
HBL also supports the development of essential skills like time management,
self-regulation, and responsibility, preparing students for future academic
and professional success.</p>
