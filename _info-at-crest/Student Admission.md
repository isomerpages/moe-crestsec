<h4>Frequently Asked Questions on Crest Secondary School (CSS)</h4>
<p><strong>1) Why is CSS set up?</strong>
<br>MOE is committed to supporting the learning needs of all students. The
establishment of CSS complements MOE’s on-going efforts in providing students
with an engaging learning experience, such as a curriculum that emphasises
the building of students’ self-motivation and self-esteem, character development,
and literacy and numeracy skills. CSS offers a&nbsp;<strong>customised four-year curriculum that integrates both academic learning and vocational training</strong>&nbsp;to
provide students with skills-based, practice-oriented learning experiences.
In addition, Character and Citizenship Education undergirds CSS’ holistic
education approach, with a strong focus on values education and social
and emotional learning to prepare students for future learning, employment
and adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>2) What is the curriculum offered at CSS?</strong>
<br>CSS offers academic subjects and the ITE Skills Subject Certificate (ISSC).
At lower secondary, students will be exposed to the 5 ITE Skills Subjects
by way of Taster Modules. This will allow them to enjoy the range of skills
options while allowing them to discover the interest and aptitude for each
area before they select 2 subjects to specialise in at upper secondary. <strong>To support the learning of our higher ability students, the school may offer English Language Mathematics and/or Mother Tongue Language at the G2 level to these students, starting from Sec 1, if they meet the school’s eligibility criteria.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>3) How are students assessed at CSS?</strong>
<br>CSS adopts a skills-based, formative assessment approach to scaffold students’
learning and enable them to achieve the learning goals. Continual assessment,
such as practice-based assessment, constitutes a major component of the
overall assessment of students’ performance across subjects. For Taster
Modules, students will sit for an end-of-module assessment at the end of
each semester. In addition, students will sit for the End-of-Year Assessments
for academic subjects.</p>
<p><strong>4) What qualifications will CSS students graduate with?</strong>
<br>CSS students will graduate at Sec 4 with the Singapore-Cambridge Secondary
Education Certificate (SEC) and the ITE Skills Subjects Certificate (ISSC).
With these qualifications, CSS students can apply for Nitec courses at
any of the three Institute of Technical Education (ITE) colleges.
<br>Sec 4 students with special talent and skills aptitude e.g. sports, performing
arts, technical &amp; vocational skills may apply to ITE for early admission
to their preferred Nitec courses via the ITE Early Admission Exercise,
prior to the release of the Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate
(SEC) results.</p>

<p><strong>6. What are the criteria for student admission into CSS?</strong>
<br>All P6, G1, G1/G2 eligible students may apply for admission to CSS. The

<p><strong>7. When must the application form for admission to Crest Secondary School be submitted to the school?</strong>
<br>Starting from 2024, Crest Secondary School will participate in MOE’s S1
Posting Exercise. Eligible students may either submit their application
to Crest Secondary School during the Pre-Registration Exercise or via the
S1 Posting Exercise portal. You may scan and email the application form
to crestsec@schools.gov.sg or by hand to the Admin Office (More details
will be spelt out in the Invitation Letter for students who qualify for
Crest Secondary School when you receive your PSLE results). The deadline
of the application is on <strong>26 November 2024, Tuesday (tentative) 3 P.M</strong>.
We advise parents/students to submit the application form early. The school

<p><strong>8. Does CSS offer financial assistance to needy students?</strong>
<br>Singapore Citizen students may apply for MOE Financial Assistance Scheme
(MOE-FAS) if they meet the gross household income or per capital income
criteria. The MOE-FAS provides needy students with free school textbooks
and stationery, school uniform and vocational attire, shoes and socks,
waiver of school and standard miscellaneous fees, and daily school meal
and transport subsidies. Students can approach the school’s Administration
Office for a MOE-FAS application form or download the application <a href="/files/fas_application_specialised_schools_2025.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">from the website</a>.
Needy students who do not meet the eligibility criteria for MOE FAS may
be considered for the School-Based FAS. Approval will be given on a case-by-case
basis.</p>
<p><strong>9. Does CSS provide bus shuttle service for students?</strong>
<br>Due to a persistent island wide shortage of drivers for both private and
public buses, the school is unable to procure shuttle bus services for
the school from 2 Jan 2024 onwards. The one-way shuttle bus service will
hence be ceased from year 2024 onwards. Students are to consider alternative
transportation arrangements, such as utilizing public transportation options
or carpooling. We appreciate support and understanding from students and
parents/guardians.</p>

<p><strong>11. What are the progression pathways after Crest?</strong>
<br>As our students study the ITE Skills Subjects, it will provide them with
a skills and aptitude advantage when they apply to ITE under the Early
Admission Scheme as they will have developed their foundation skills for
many Nitec courses at Crest.
<br>Students in Crest specialises in 2 ITE Skills Subjects (which will be
equivalent to 2 G1 passes). This means that they will be equipped with
vocational and technical skills advantage when they apply to ITE under
the ITE Early Admission Scheme. They will be able to apply to a wide range
of related Nitec courses in ITE if they meet the respective entry requirements.
More than 90% of our graduated students can progress to ITE for a skills
course at the Nitec level. From there, depending on how well they perform,
many will be able to progress to a Diploma or Higher Nitec programme at
ITE or a Polytechnic.</p>
