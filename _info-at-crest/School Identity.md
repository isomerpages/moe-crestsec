The school, which is legally owned by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), is registered as a Company with Limited Guarantee with ACRA and is granted the Charity and Institution of Public Character status under the Charities Act. It is managed by a Board of Directors chaired by Mr Wilson Tan Wee Yan and is led by Principal Mr Benjamin Kwok.

  

The school is part of MOE’s West 4 Cluster of Schools.

Our Background
--------------

Crest Secondary School, which offers a customised curriculum for G1 students, took in its first batch of Secondary One students in January 2013. First announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the 2010 National Day Rally, the pioneering school team has selected Crest as the school’s name to underline the aspirational aim of helping every Crestan develop and rise to his/her potential, regardless of background, and to graduate as a confident individual, anchored in sound values and equipped with the skills to succeed in future learning, employment and life.

  

Crest’s pioneering team comprises experienced School Leaders, Heads of Department and Teachers seconded from the Ministry of Education and the Institute of Technical Education. Their decision to come on-board the school is motivated by their strong passion for working with G1 students and making a significant difference in their lives.

  

Crest will offer a customized Sec One to Sec Four curriculum that integrates both&nbsp;[academic learning](/aesthetics/programmes/academic-curriculum/permalink)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[vocational training.](/programmes/vocational-curriculum/permalink)&nbsp;Learning will be practice-oriented, with an emphasis on skills development to prepare students for progression to post-secondary skills training at the ITE and for employment. Industrial attachment will be an important component of the ISSC learning experience for the students, spanning about 200 hours from Sec Three to Sec Four. In addition, the school will adopt innovative pedagogies to strengthen students’ literacy and numeracy skills through real-world, ICT-enriched learning contexts.

  

A key cornerstone of the school’s holistic education is the approach in building students’ character, with a strong focus on values education and strengthening social and emotional competencies. The aim is to develop Crestans as well-rounded individuals, anchored in good character and equipped with useful vocational and life skills.

  

At the end of their four-year journey, Crestans will graduate with the Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) and the ITE Skills Subject Certificate (ISSC).
