<p>Crest Secondary School offers a customised curriculum for students in
the G1 stream. The school operates similar to an independent school.</p>
<p>The school, which is legally owned by the Institute of Technical Education
(ITE), is registered as a Company with Limited Guarantee with ACRA and
is granted the Charity and Institution of Public Character status under
the Charities Act. It is managed by a Board of Directors chaired by Mr
Wilson Tan Wee Yan and is led by Principal Mr Benjamin Kwok.</p>
<p>The school is part of MOE’s West 4 Cluster of Schools.</p>
<h2>Our Background</h2>
<p>Crest Secondary School, which offers a customised curriculum for G1 students,
took in its first batch of Secondary One students in January 2013. First
announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the 2010 National Day Rally,
the pioneering school team has selected Crest as the school’s name to underline
the aspirational aim of helping every Crestan develop and rise to his/her
potential, regardless of background, and to graduate as a confident individual,
anchored in sound values and equipped with the skills to succeed in future
learning, employment and life.</p>
<p>Crest’s pioneering team comprises experienced School Leaders, Heads of
Department and Teachers seconded from the Ministry of Education and the
Institute of Technical Education. Their decision to come on-board the school
is motivated by their strong passion for working with G1 students and making
a significant difference in their lives.</p>
<p>Crest will offer a customized Sec One to Sec Four curriculum that integrates
both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.crestsec.edu.sg/programmes/academic-curriculum/aesthetics/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">academic learning</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.crestsec.edu.sg/discovery-modules/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">vocational training</a><a href="/programmes/vocational-curriculum/permalink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">.</a>&nbsp;Learning
will be practice-oriented, with an emphasis on skills development to prepare
students for progression to post-secondary skills training at the ITE and
for employment. Industrial attachment will be an important component of
the ISSC learning experience for the students, spanning about 200 hours
from Sec Three to Sec Four. In addition, the school will adopt innovative
pedagogies to strengthen students’ literacy and numeracy skills through
real-world, ICT-enriched learning contexts.</p>
<p>A key cornerstone of the school’s holistic education is the approach in
building students’ character, with a strong focus on values education and
strengthening social and emotional competencies. The aim is to develop
Crestans as well-rounded individuals, anchored in good character and equipped
with useful vocational and life skills.</p>
<p>At the end of their four-year journey, Crestans will graduate with the
Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) and the ITE Skills
Subject Certificate (ISSC).</p>

<p>The school logo, based on the theme CREating Student Transformation (CREST),
comprises of four outward expanding waves, reflecting the transformation
of our students from Secondary One to Secondary Four as they grow in character
(represented by the light blue waves) and attain breakthroughs in personal
achievements (represented by the yellow waves). This transformation is
made possible by the 'sea of opportunities' (represented by the dark blue
background) that the school provides to enrich students' learning and enhance
their personal growth.</p>

<p><strong>Verse 1:</strong>
</p>
<p><em>I have found a place</em>
<br><em>Where my heart is free to dream</em>
<br><em>It's here that I belong</em>
<br><em>Where strength rises from within</em>
<br><em>All the things I hope for</em>
<br><em>They're mine to strive for</em>
<br><em>I'll rise up to the challenge</em>
<br><em>To turn my dreams into reality</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
</p>
<p><em>I know I can</em>
<br><em>I'm reaching high</em>
<br><em>To touch the sky</em>
<br><em>I'm not afraid to try</em>
<br><em>To realise my dreams</em>
<br><em>Upon this Crest</em>
<br><em>I'll do my best</em>
<br><em>To be all that I was meant to be</em>
<br><em>I'll shout it to the world</em>
<br><em>I know I can</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2:</strong>
</p>
<p><em>The road will not be easy</em>
<br><em>But no matter how long it seems</em>
<br><em>I'll just keep walking on</em>
<br><em>I'll never give up on my dreams</em>
<br><em>There'll always be a helping hand</em>
<br><em>And someone who will be a friend</em>
<br><em>In this place that feels like home</em>
<br><em>I know I'll never have to walk alone</em>
</p>
<p><strong>(Chorus x 2)</strong>
