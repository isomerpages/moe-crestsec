#### Frequently Asked Questions on Crest Secondary School (CSS)

  
**1) Why is CSS set up as a Specialised School for Normal (Technical) students?**  
MOE is committed to supporting the learning needs of our students. The establishment of CSS complements MOE’s on-going efforts in providing students with G1 subjects with an engaging learning experience, such as a curriculum that emphasises the building of students’ self-motivation and self-esteem, character development, and literacy and numeracy skills. CSS offers a&nbsp;**customised four-year G1 curriculum that integrates both academic learning and vocational training**&nbsp;to provide students with skills-based, practice-oriented learning experiences. In addition, Character and Citizenship Education undergirds CSS’ holistic education approach, with a strong focus on values education and social and emotional learning to prepare students for future learning, employment and adulthood.  
  
**2) What is the curriculum offered at CSS?**  
CSS offers both G1 subjects and the ITE Skills Subject Certificate (ISSC). At lower secondary, students will be exposed to the 5 ITE Skills Subjects by way of Taster Modules. This will allow them to enjoy the range of skills options while allowing them to discover the interest and aptitude for each area before they select 2 subjects to specialise in at upper secondary. To support the learning of our higher ability students, the school may offer English Language Mathematics and/or Mother Tongue Language at the G2 level to these students, starting from Sec 1, if they meet the school’s eligibility criteria.  
  
**3) How are students assessed at CSS?**  
CSS adopts a skills-based, formative assessment approach to scaffold students’ learning and enable them to achieve the learning goals. Continual assessment, such as practice-based assessment, constitutes a major component of the overall assessment of students’ performance across subjects. For Taster Modules, students will sit for an end-of-module assessment at the end of each semester. In addition, students will sit for the End-of-Year Assessments for academic subjects.  
  
**4) What qualifications will CSS students graduate with?**  
CSS students will graduate at Sec 4 with the GCE ‘N(T)’ Level Certificate in English Language, Mathematics and Basic Mother Tongue (and Science for some students) and the ITE Skills Subjects Certificate (ISSC). With these qualifications, CSS students can apply for Nitec courses at any of the three Institute of Technical Education (ITE) colleges.  
Sec 4 students with special talent and skills aptitude e.g. sports, performing arts, technical &amp; vocational skills may apply to ITE for early admission to their preferred Nitec courses via the ITE Early Admission Exercise, prior to the release of the GCE ‘N’ Level Examination results.

**11\. What are the progression pathways after Crest?**  
As our students study the ITE Skills Subjects, it will provide them with a skills and aptitude advantage when they apply to ITE under the Early Admission Scheme as they will have developed their foundation skills for many Nitec courses at Crest.  
Students in Crest specialises in 2 ITE Skills Subjects (which will be equivalent to 2 G1 passes). This means that they will be equipped with vocational and technical skills advantage when they apply to ITE under the ITE Early Admission Scheme. They will be able to apply to a wide range of related Nitec courses in ITE if they meet the respective entry requirements. More than 90% of our graduated students can progress to ITE for a skills course at the Nitec level. From there, depending on how well they perform, many will be able to progress to a Diploma or Higher Nitec programme at ITE or a Polytechnic.
