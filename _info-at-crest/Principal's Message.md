<h3>Principal's Message</h3>
<p>Every parent and child hopes for a school that truly cares, offers an
exciting and meaningful curriculum, and opens good choices for the future.
At Crest Secondary School, we make it happen through these three pillars—care,
curriculum, and choices— are woven into everything we do to develop enterprising
students who are adventurous, benevolent, and charismatic.</p>
<h4>A Community That Truly Cares</h4>
<p>At Crest, caring isn't just a value we talk about—it's something you feel
the moment you walk through our doors. Our small classes of about 20 students,
each with two dedicated Form Teachers, mean that every child is truly known
and valued. When a student struggles, we notice. When they achieve something
special, we celebrate together.</p>
<p>What makes our care so genuine is that every teacher and staff member
chose to be here. No one is posted to Crest—they come because they believe
wholeheartedly in our students and mission. Together with our counsellors,
special needs officers, student welfare officers, and educational psychologist,
we create an extraordinary sense of family. We're incredibly proud that
this caring approach earned us the Lee Hsien Loong Award for Innovations
in Uplifting Students, and we're equally thrilled that our student Mah
Yan Lin was awarded the prestigious Lee Kuan Yew All-Round Excellence Award—a
recognition given to only 12 secondary school students nationwide.</p>
<h4>A Curriculum That Excites and Engages</h4>
<p>Learning at Crest is far from ordinary. Our students don't just read about
engineering—they design smart systems and build working models. They don't
just study hospitality—they run our school café. Our curriculum brilliantly
blends academic rigour with hands-on vocational experiences across mechanical
design, culinary arts, retail services, internet of things and mobile web
applications.</p>
<p>The magic happens in our four-week Industrial Experience Programme, where
every student works alongside professionals in real companies, earning
an allowance while developing technical skills and workplace confidence.
They return with stories, skills, and most importantly, a clear sense of
what excites them about their future.</p>
<h4>Choices That Open Doors</h4>
<p>We believe every student should graduate with genuine options that honour
their unique strengths. Our programmes prepare students for the Early Admission
Exercise (EAE), and many secure places in Higher Nitec courses at ITE even
before their final examinations. Through strong partnerships with industry
and educational institutions, we help students explore pathways beyond
Crest.</p>
<p>Whether a student dreams of becoming a chef, an engineer, an entrepreneur,
or is still discovering their passion, we ensure they have the skills,
confidence, and connections to pursue their chosen path.</p>
<p>Crest is so much more than a school—we're a community built on genuine
care, engaging learning, and boundless possibilities. Together with parents
and stakeholders, we're committed to unlocking every student's potential
and celebrating their unique journey to success.</p>
<p>“I know I can, I know you can, Together we can”</p>
