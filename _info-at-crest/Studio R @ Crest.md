<p><strong>Studio R @ Crest : Transforming Futures Through Digital Skills</strong>
</p>
<p>Studio R is launching a dynamic 6-month programme on 1<sup>st</sup> April,
2025 that is designed for participants who have just graduated from secondary
school, and have completed their N-levels and interested in returning to
education via ITE. We have designed a &nbsp;baseball jersey as Studio R's
uniform which symbolises teamwork, perseverance, and shared goals. Just
as baseball players strive to reach home base, Studio R guides students
through the bases of their educational journey, aiming for life’s ‘home
run’. Our curriculum focuses on industry-relevant digital skills through
two ITE Skills Subjects (ISS): Retail &amp; E-commerce (ReC) and Internet
of Things Applications (IoTA).</p>
